# DevAdventCalendarMod
DevAdventCalendarMod is a mod for Gorilla Tag that adds an advent calendar to the game, in both the forest and mountain maps.    
Just like any other advent calendar, you get a chocolate a day. By the time you're done eating all of the chocolates, a secret ending is unlocked.
