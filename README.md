# DevAdventCalandarMod
Each day when you open Gorilla Tag, on top of your cosmetic wardrobe you spawn near, an advent calandar opens up a certain amount of boxes based on what day it is until it is the last day which is December 25th. By touching the chocolate you see with your index finger with either your left or right hand, you'll pick it up and eat it up afterwards if you want to.
